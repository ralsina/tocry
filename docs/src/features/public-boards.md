# Public Boards

Share your boards publicly with read-only access.

## Public Access

ToCry supports making boards publicly accessible:

### Public Boards

- **Open Access**: Anyone with the link can view the board
- **No Authentication**: Visitors don't need to create accounts
- **Read-Only**: Visitors can see but not modify content
- **Shareable Links**: Generate URLs for public access

## Use Cases

- **Project Showcases**: Share project progress with stakeholders
- **Portfolio Display**: Show completed work to potential clients
- **Public Documentation**: Create publicly accessible task boards
- **Team Transparency**: Share progress with external partners
