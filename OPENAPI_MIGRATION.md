# OpenAPI Spec Generation - Summary

## Problem
The ToCry web app needed to be migrated to use OpenAPI-based clients for both the web frontend and API testing. The existing setup using the Crystal Swagger library had limitations that prevented proper OpenAPI 3.0 spec generation, specifically:

1. The Swagger library's `Property` class doesn't support the `items` field required for array types in OpenAPI 3.0
2. Nested schemas couldn't be properly defined within request/response bodies
3. The library's abstractions made it difficult to express complex schema structures

## Solution
Instead of trying to work around the Swagger library's limitations, we created a direct manual OpenAPI spec generator (`src/openapi_manual.cr`) that:

1. **Generates proper OpenAPI 3.0 spec directly** - Bypasses the Swagger library entirely for spec generation
2. **Supports full array item definitions** - All arrays properly define their item types
3. **Maintains schema references** - Component schemas are properly referenced in responses
4. **Matches actual endpoint behavior** - Spec is written based on what the endpoints actually do

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`src/openapi_manual.cr`** (NEW)
   - Direct OpenAPI spec generator
   - Uses Crystal hash/JSON structures
   - Properly defines all array items
   - Includes all endpoints with accurate schemas

2. **`generate_clients.sh`** (MODIFIED)
   - Now uses `crystal run src/openapi_manual.cr` instead of the Swagger-based generator
   - Simplified workflow: generate → validate → create clients

3. **`src/openapi/common.cr`** (MODIFIED)
   - Updated response schemas to match actual endpoint behavior
   - Added helpers for note responses with data
   - Added helpers for upload/attachment responses

4. **`src/openapi/swagger_extensions.cr`** (CREATED BUT NOT USED)
   - Initial attempt at extending Swagger library
   - Kept for reference but not needed with direct generation approach

5. **`fix_openapi_arrays.cr`** (CREATED BUT NOT USED)
   - Post-processing script to fix arrays
   - Not needed with direct generation approach

### Endpoints Documented:

**Boards:**
- `GET /api/v1/boards` - List all accessible boards
- `POST /api/v1/boards` - Create new board
- `GET /api/v1/boards/{board_name}` - Get board details with lanes and notes
- `PUT /api/v1/boards/{board_name}` - Update board (rename, reorder lanes, etc.)
- `DELETE /api/v1/boards/{board_name}` - Delete board (idempotent)
- `POST /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/share` - Share board with user

**Notes:**
- `POST /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note` - Create note in lane
- `PUT /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note/{note_id}` - Update/move note
- `DELETE /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note/{note_id}` - Delete note (idempotent)
- `POST /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note/{note_id}/attach` - Attach file to note
- `GET /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note/{note_id}/{attachment}` - Download attachment
- `DELETE /api/v1/boards/{board_name}/note/{note_id}/{attachment}` - Delete attachment (idempotent)
- `GET /api/v1/attachments/{note_id}/{filename}` - Public attachment access

**Uploads:**
- `POST /api/v1/upload/image` - Upload image file

**Authentication:**
- `GET /api/v1/auth_mode` - Get authentication mode

## Validation Status

✅ **OpenAPI spec validates successfully**
- Only 1 warning about unused "Board" model (false positive - it is used)
- All array types have proper `items` definitions
- All schemas properly defined with correct types

✅ **Clients generated successfully**
- Crystal client: `lib/tocry_api/`
- JavaScript client: `src/assets/api_client/`

## Key Features of Generated Spec

1. **Proper Array Types:**
   ```json
   "tags": {
     "type": "array",
     "items": {"type": "string"},
     "description": "Array of tags for the note"
   }
   ```

2. **Schema References:**
   ```json
   "lanes": {
     "type": "array",
     "items": {"$ref": "#/components/schemas/Lane"}
   }
   ```

3. **Inline Object Arrays:**
   ```json
   "lanes": {
     "type": "array",
     "items": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "name": {"type": "string"}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Complete Response Schemas:**
   - Note creation/update returns the note object with all fields
   - Upload responses include URLs, file sizes, and identifiers
   - All error responses consistently structured

## Next Steps

To regenerate clients after endpoint changes:
```bash
./generate_clients.sh
```

To validate the spec manually:
```bash
openapi-generator-cli validate -i openapi.json
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Spec is now readable Crystal code, easy to modify
2. **Accuracy**: Spec matches actual endpoint behavior exactly
3. **Completeness**: All OpenAPI 3.0 features properly supported
4. **Simplicity**: No library limitations or workarounds needed
5. **Validation**: Passes OpenAPI 3.0 validation with proper array item definitions
