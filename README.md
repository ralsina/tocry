# tocry

`tocry` is a simple, self-hosted Kanban-style TODO application. It's designed to be a straightforward tool for managing tasks across different stages or categories. The name comes from the eternal question every developer faces when looking at their task list: "Are you going ToDo or ToCry?"

## Features

* **Drag & Drop:** Easily move notes between lanes and reorder lanes themselves
* **Rich Text Notes:** Write notes in Markdown, with a comfortable WYSIWYG editor
* **Inline Editing:** Quickly rename lanes by clicking on their titles
* **Live Search:** Instantly filter all notes by title, content, or tags
* **Collapsible Notes:** Collapse notes with content to keep your board tidy
* **Light & Dark Modes:** Switch between themes for your viewing comfort
* **Responsive UI:** A clean interface that works on different screen sizes
